# OAUTH USING GOOGLE (PoC)

This proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates authentication using Google, serving as a foundation for applications requiring user authentication and authorization. With this PoC, you can easily authenticate using your Google account, and your login session will be stored in session storage. This means that as long as you remain logged in, either until you manually log out or the session cookie is cleared, you will maintain access to the application. This implementation not only simplifies the authentication process but also enhances user experience by ensuring a seamless login experience.
